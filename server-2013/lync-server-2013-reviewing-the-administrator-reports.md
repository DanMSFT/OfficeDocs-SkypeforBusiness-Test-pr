# Reviewing the Administrator Reports in Lync Server 2013

 


The Administrator Reports are detailed information for deployment and operations. The reports are generated based on the selections marked in **Design Sites**. The designer can further add value to the Administrator Reports by editing the network diagrams and defining the complete IP addresses and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) for servers, pools, and load balancers.
