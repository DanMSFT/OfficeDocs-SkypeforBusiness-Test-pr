# Certificate requirements for Persistent Chat server in Lync Server 2013

 


To install Persistent Chat Server, you must have a certificate issued by the same CA as the one used by Lync Server 2013 internal servers for each server running the Persistent Chat Web Services for File Upload/Download. Make sure that you have the required certificate(s) before you start the Persistent Chat installation, especially if you are using an external CA.
