# Wildcard certificate support in Lync Server 2013

 


Lync Server 2013 uses certificates to provide communications encryption and server identity authentication. In some cases, such as web publishing through the reverse proxy, strong subject alternative name (SAN) entry matching to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the server presenting the service is not required. In these cases, you can use certificates with wildcard SAN entries (commonly known as “wildcard certificates”) to reduce the cost of a certificate requested from a public certification authority and to reduce the complexity of the planning process for certificates.


> [!WARNING]
> To retain the functionality of unified communications (UC) devices (for example, desk phones), you should test the deployed certificate carefully to ensure that devices function properly after you implement a wildcard certificate.



There is no support for a wildcard entry as the subject name (also referred to as the common name or CN) for any role. The following server roles are supported when using wildcard entries in the SAN:

  -  
    **Reverse proxy.**   Wildcard SAN entry is supported for Simple URL (meet and dialin) publishing certificate.

  -  
    **Reverse proxy.**   Wildcard SAN entry is supported for the SAN entries for LyncDiscover on the publishing certificate.

  -  
    **Director.**   Wildcard SAN entry is supported for Simple URLs (meet and dialin) and for SAN entries for LyncDiscover and LyncDiscoverInternal in Director web components.

  -  
    **Front End Server (Standard Edition) and Front End pool (Enterprise Edition).** Wildcard SAN entry is supported for Simple URLs (meet and dialin) and for SAN entries for LyncDiscover and LyncDiscoverInternal in Front End web components.

  -  
    **Exchange Unified Messaging (UM).**   The server does not use SAN entries when deployed as a stand-alone server.

  -  
    **Microsoft Exchange Server Client Access server.**   Wildcard entries in the SAN are supported for internal and external clients.

  -  
    **Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) and Microsoft Exchange Server Client Access server on same server.**   Wildcard SAN entries are supported.

Server roles that are not addressed in this topic:

  - Internal server roles (including, but not limited to the Mediation Server, Archiving and Monitoring Server, Survivable Branch Appliance, or Survivable Branch Server)

  - External Edge Server interfaces

  - Internal Edge Server
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > For the internal Edge Server interface, a wildcard entry can be assigned to the SAN, and is supported. The SAN on the internal Edge Server is not queried, and a wildcard SAN entry is of limited value.
