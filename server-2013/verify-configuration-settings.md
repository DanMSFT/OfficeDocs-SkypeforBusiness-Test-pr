# Verify configuration settings

 


You can validate the replication of configuration information to the Edge server by running the Lync Server 2013 **Get-CsManagementStoreReplicationStatus** cmdlet on the internal computer on which the Central Management store is located, or on any domain joined computer on which Lync Server 2013 Core Components (OcsCore.msi) is installed.

Initial results may indicate the status as "False" instead of "True" for replication. If so, run the **Invoke-CsManagementStoreReplication** cmdlet and allow time for the replication to complete before running the **Get-CsManagementStoreReplicationStatus** again.
