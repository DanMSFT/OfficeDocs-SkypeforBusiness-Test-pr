# Choosing an E9-1-1 service provider for Lync Server 2013

 


The E9-1-1 service provider routes emergency calls originating from Lync Server to the correct Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) based on the location information contained within the call.

To support E9-1-1 as part of a Lync Server deployment, you must obtain E9-1-1 routing service from a Lync Open Interoperability Program qualified E9-1-1 service provider. Choose the provider that best fits your organizational requirements.
