# Setting up the infrastructure for Archiving in Lync Server 2013

 


The infrastructure requirements for Archiving are the same as for your Lync Server deployment, except for storage. No additional infrastructure setup is required, except for setting up storage using Exchange 2013 storage, Archiving databases, or both. For details about infrastructure requirements for Lync Server 2013, see [Determining your infrastructure requirements for Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-determining-your-infrastructure-requirements.md) in the Planning documentation and [Preparing the infrastructure and systems for Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-preparing-the-infrastructure-and-systems.md) in the Deployment documentation. For details about storage requirements for Archiving, see [Technical requirements for Archiving in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-technical-requirements-for-archiving.md) in the Planning documentation, [Setting up system platforms for Archiving in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-setting-up-system-platforms-for-archiving.md) in the Deployment documentation, and [Setting up storage for Archiving in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-setting-up-storage-for-archiving.md) in the Deployment documentation.
