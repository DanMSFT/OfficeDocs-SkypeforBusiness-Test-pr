# Monitoring, starting, and stopping the Persistent Chat services in Lync Server 2013

 


The Persistent Chat services and Persistent Chat Compliance services are part of the Lync Server 2013 topology and can therefore be monitored, stopped, and started by using the Windows PowerShell cmdlets, **get-CsWindowsService**, **stop-CsWindowsService**, and **start-CsWindowsService**, respectively.
