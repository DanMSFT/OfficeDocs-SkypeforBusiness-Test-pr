# Planning for devices in Lync Server 2013

 


Lync Server 2013 includes Lync Phone Edition, software that runs on qualified devices and provides traditional and advanced telephony features, integrated security, manageability, and more. Lync Phone Edition works the same way with Lync Server 2013 as it does with Lync Server 2010. For details about planning for devices, see [Planning for Devices](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=285880) in the Lync Server 2010 TechNet Library.
