# Run Best Practices Analyzer

 


The Office Communications Server 2007 R2 Best Practices Analyzer tool gathers configuration information from an Office Communications Server 2007 R2 deployment and determines whether the configuration is set according to Microsoft best practices. You can install the tool on a client computer that runs Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0, or directly on the server that runs Office Communications Server 2007 R2. We recommend that you install and run this tool on a client computer. The Office Communications Server 2007 R2 Administrative Tools should also be installed locally on the client computer so that the Best Practices Analyzer can collect a full set of data.

You can download the Office Communications Server 2007 R2 Best Practices Analyzer from the Microsoft Download Center at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268702](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=268702).
