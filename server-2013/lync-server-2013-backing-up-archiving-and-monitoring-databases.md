# Backing up Archiving and Monitoring databases in Lync Server 2013

 


If you deployed Archiving or Monitoring, you need to back up these databases according to your organization's SQL Server backup policy.


> [!NOTE]
> The settings for Archiving and Monitoring are backed up when you back up the Central Management store. For details, see <A href="lync-server-2013-backing-up-core-data-and-settings.md">Backing up core data and settings in Lync Server 2013</A>.



For Archiving and Monitoring, you can use a SQL Server tool such as SQL Server Management Studio to perform a manual backup, or you can use SQL Server management tools to schedule regular, automatic backups.
