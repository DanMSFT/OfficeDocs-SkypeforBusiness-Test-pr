# Phase 6: Move users to the pilot pool

 


You can move a single user or groups of users to the new Lync Server 2013 deployment using the following two methods: Lync Server Control Panel and Lync Server Management Shell. The topics in this section describe tasks you must complete during pilot deployment, as well as prior to moving your deployment of Lync Server 2013 from a pilot deployment to a production-level deployment.
