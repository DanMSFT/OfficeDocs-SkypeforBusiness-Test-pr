# Scaled Director pool in Lync Server 2013

 


The Director can be deployed in either a single Director configuration, or as a Director pool. This section defines a topology and configuration for two pooled Director topologies. If you are planning on deploying a single Director, see the topic [Single Director in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-single-director.md) for planning considerations for that topology.
