# Outgoing calls in Lync Server 2013

 


The routing of outbound calls of users enabled for Location-Based Routing is affected by the network location of the user’s endpoint. The following table illustrates how Location-Based Routing affects the routing of outbound calls depending on the location of the caller’s endpoint.
