# Remove a legacy authorized host in Lync Server 2013 (optional)

 


When you migrate remote call control to a Lync Server deployment, you must remove legacy authorized host entries (known as *trusted application entries* in Lync Server) for any SIP/CSTA gateways in your legacy deployment. You must use the administrative tools to remove authorized host entries from those deployments, respectively.
