# Virtualization support in Lync Server 2013

 


Lync Server 2013 supports virtualization topologies that support all Lync Server workloads, including instant messaging (IM) and presence, conferencing, Enterprise Voice, Monitoring, Archiving, and Persistent Chat. Note that Lync Server performance on virtual topologies can vary greatly depending on the workloads being used, the number of users, and the host hardware. For detailed guidance about running Lync Server 2013 on virtual servers, see the white paper [Planning a Lync Server 2013 Deployment on Virtual Servers](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41936).

Lync Server 2013 is supported on the Hyper-V platform, and on any virtualization platform that is supported under the Windows Server Virtualization Validation Program. For information on this program, see <http://www.windowsservercatalog.com/svvp.aspx>.
