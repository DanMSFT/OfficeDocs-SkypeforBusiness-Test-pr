# Network region routes in Lync Server 2013

 


A *network region route* defines the route between a pair of network regions. Each pair of network regions in your call admission control deployment requires a network region route. This enables every network region within the deployment to access every other region. Use the procedures in this section to view, create, modify, or delete network region routes.
