# DNS requirements for Edge Servers and features in Lync Server 2013

 


Lync Server 2013 Edge Servers, Edge pools, and reverse proxies have specific requirements for Domain Name System (DNS) records. In Lync Server 2013 when IPv4 and IPv6 are in use, you must plan for both host A and AAAA records.

The topics listed below define the use of DNS records for your deployment planning:
