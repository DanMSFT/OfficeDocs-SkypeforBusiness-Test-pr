# Integration of Persistent Chat management tools in Lync Server 2013

 


Lync Server 2013 simplifies the administration of Persistent Chat Server by integrating its administration tools with the tools used for the rest of Lync Server.

Persistent Chat Server includes an administrative user interface experience integrated with the Lync Server Control Panel. Also, Persistent Chat Server includes a collection of Windows PowerShell cmdlets to administer and manage Persistent Chat Server categories, rooms (including deleting rooms and purging obsolete content), and add-ins.
