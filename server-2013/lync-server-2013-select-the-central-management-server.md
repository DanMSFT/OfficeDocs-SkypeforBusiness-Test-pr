# Select the Central Management Server in Lync Server 2013

 


Before you can define and configure your topology, you must first define the location to install the Central Management Server.


> [!NOTE]
> This will not take effect until you have published a topology in Topology Builder. To set the Central Management Server before the topology is created and published, run <STRONG>Set-CSConfigurationStoreLocation</STRONG>.



## To select the Central Management Server

1.  Start Topology Builder: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Lync Server 2013**, and then click **Lync Server Topology Builder**.

2.  Right-click the Lync Server 2013 node, and then click **Edit Properties**.

3.  In the Central Management Server pane, select the Front End Server to install the Central Management Server on and then click **OK**.
