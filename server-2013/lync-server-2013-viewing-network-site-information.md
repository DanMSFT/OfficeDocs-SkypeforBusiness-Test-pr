# Viewing network site information in Lync Server 2013

 


Network sites are the offices or locations configured within each region of a call admission control (CAC) or Enhanced 9-1-1 deployment. You can view network site information in either Lync Server 2013 Control Panel or Lync Server Management Shell . For details about creating or modifying network sites, see [Creating or modifying network sites in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-creating-or-modifying-network-sites.md).

## To view network site information in Lync Server Control Panel

1.  From a user account that is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group (or has equivalent user rights), or is assigned to the CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer in your internal deployment.

2.  Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Lync Server Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server 2013 administrative tools](lync-server-2013-open-lync-server-administrative-tools.md).

3.  In the left navigation bar, click **Network Configuration** and then click **Site**.

4.  On the **Site** page, click the site that you want to view.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can only view information for one site at a time.



5.  On the **Edit** menu, click **Show details**.

## Viewing Network Site Information by Using Windows PowerShell Cmdlets

You can view network site information by using Windows PowerShell and the Get-CsNetworkSite cmdlet. This cmdlet can be run either from the Lync Server 2013 Management Shell or from a remote session of Windows PowerShell. For details about using remote Windows PowerShell to connect to Lync Server, see the Lync Server Windows PowerShell blog article "Quick Start: Managing Microsoft Lync Server 2010 Using Remote PowerShell" at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=255876](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=255876).

## To view network site information

  - To view information about all your network sites, type the following command in the Lync Server Management Shell and then press ENTER:
    
        Get-CsNetworkSite
    
    That will return information similar to this:
    
        Identity          : Redmond
        NetworkSiteID     : Redmond
        Description       :
        NetworkRegionID   : Pacific Northwest
        BypassID          : 3b232b84-2c1d-4da2-8181-e9330bafebe9
        BWPolicyProfileID :
        LocationPolicy    :

For more information, see the help topic for the [Get-CsNetworkSite](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg398766\(v=ocs.15\)) cmdlet.
