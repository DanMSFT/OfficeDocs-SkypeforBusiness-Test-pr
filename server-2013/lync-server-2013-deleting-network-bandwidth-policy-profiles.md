# Deleting network bandwidth policy profiles in Lync Server 2013

 


As part of call admission control (CAC), a bandwidth policy is used to define bandwidth limitations for certain modalities. In Microsoft Lync Server 2013, only audio and video modalities can be assigned bandwidth limitations. You can set overall bandwidth limitations and session limitations. You can use the Lync Server Control Panel to create, modify, or delete a container profile for these policies. Use the following procedures to delete a network bandwidth policy profiles. For details on creating or modifying a network bandwidth policy profile, see [Creating or modifying bandwidth policy profiles in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-creating-or-modifying-bandwidth-policy-profiles.md).

2.  Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Lync Server Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server 2013 administrative tools](lync-server-2013-open-lync-server-administrative-tools.md).

3.  In the left navigation bar, click **Network Configuration** and then click **Bandwidth Policy**.
