# Lync Server 2013 hybrid

 


With Lync hybrid deployments, you can have some of your Lync users on-premises, and other users in Lync Online, both sharing the same domain. This can make it easier to provide Lync services to users of your organization in different geographic locations or users that connect remotely. You can also take advantage of Lync hybrid configurations as a migration path to Office 365.

This section describes hybrid configurations for Lync Server 2013.
