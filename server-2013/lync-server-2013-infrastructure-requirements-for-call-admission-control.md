# Infrastructure requirements for call admission control in Lync Server 2013

 


No additional infrastructure requirements, such as special network routers, are necessary. Deploying Lync Server 2013 will automatically install the Bandwidth Policy Service used to enforce call admission control (CAC) policies. Call admission control works only with clients running Lync.
