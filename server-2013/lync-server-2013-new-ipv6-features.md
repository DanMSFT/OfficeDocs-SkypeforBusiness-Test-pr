# New IPv6 features in Lync Server 2013

 


Lync Server 2013 includes support for IPv6 addresses. Due to an increasing number of devices requiring IP addresses, the number of available IPv4 addresses, which are 32-bit addresses, is running out. IPv6 provides a much larger number of available addresses, because it uses 128-bit addresses. Use of IPv6 addresses in your environment depends on support for IPv6 in the devices you use.

Because many existing devices do not yet support IPv6, a complete transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is likely to take several years. Therefore, Lync Server 2013 includes support for network environments with only IPv4 addresses, only IPv6 addresses, and dual-stack (both IPv4 and IPv6) addresses.
