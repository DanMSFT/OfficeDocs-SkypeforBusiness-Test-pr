# Enabling a user to manage categories, chat rooms, and user rights and permissions in Lync Server 2013

 


Members of the **CsPersistentChatAdministrator** role (Persistent Chat administrators) can grant chat room manager rights and permissions to other users and to themselves.

A Persistent Chat administrator can do the following:

  - Create room categories and chat rooms.

  - Set the membership of all categories and chat rooms.

  - Manage all settings of all categories and chat rooms.

  - Enable or disable policy for Persistent Chat Server.

  - Set and manage configuration settings on a Persistent Chat Server pool.

For details, see [Adding a Persistent Chat administrator in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-adding-a-persistent-chat-administrator.md) in the Deployment documentation.
