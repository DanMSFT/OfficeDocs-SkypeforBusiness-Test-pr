# Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) and Mediation Server in Lync Server 2013

 


The Mediation Server has extended capabilities so that it can correctly interact with Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) service providers. No special configuration is needed on the Mediation Server; the SIP extensions required for E9-1-1 interaction are, by default, included in the Mediation Server’s SIP protocol for its interactions with a gateway peer (PSTN gateway, IP-PBX, or the SBC of an Internet Telephony Service Provider, including E9-1-1 Service Providers)

Whether the SIP trunk to an E9-1-1 Service Provider can be terminated on an existing Mediation Server pool or will require stand-alone Mediation Servers will depend on whether the E9-1-1 SBC can interact with a pool of Mediation Servers. For details, see [M:N trunk in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-m-n-trunk.md).
