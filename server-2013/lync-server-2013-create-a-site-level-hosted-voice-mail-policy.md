# Create a site-level hosted voice mail policy in Lync Server 2013

 


A *site* policy can impact all users that are homed on the site for which the policy is defined. If a user is configured for hosted Exchange UM access and has not been assigned a Per-user policy, the site policy applies. If you have not deployed a site policy, the global policy applies.

For details about configuring site policies, see the Lync Server Management Shell documentation for the following cmdlets:

  - [New-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg398653\(v=ocs.15\))

  - [Set-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg412722\(v=ocs.15\))

  - [Get-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg398348\(v=ocs.15\))

## To create a site hosted voice mail policy

1.  Start the Lync Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Lync Server 2013**, and then click **Lync Server Management Shell**.

2.  Run the New-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy cmdlet to create the policy. For example, run:
    
        New-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity site:Redmond -Destination ExUM.fabrikam.com -Description "Hosted voice mail policy for the Redmond site." -Organization "corp1.litwareinc.com, corp2.litwareinc.com"
    
    This example creates a hosted voice mail policy with site scope, and sets the following parameters:
    
      - **Identity** specifies a unique identifier for the policy, which includes the scope. For a policy with site scope, the Identity parameter value must be specified in the format `site:`*\<name\>*, for example, `site:Redmond`.
    
      - **Destination** specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the hosted Exchange UM service. This parameter is optional, but if you attempt to enable a user for hosted voice mail and the user’s assigned policy does not have a Destination value, the enable will fail.
    
      - **Description** provides optional descriptive information about the policy.
    
      - **Organization** specifies a comma-separated list of the Exchange tenants that home Lync Server 2013 users. Each tenant must be specified as the FQDN of that tenant on the hosted Exchange UM service.
