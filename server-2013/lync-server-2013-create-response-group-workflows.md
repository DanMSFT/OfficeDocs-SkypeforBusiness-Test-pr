# Create Response Group workflows in Lync Server 2013

 


A workflow defines the behavior of a call from the time that the phone rings to the time that someone answers the call. The workflow specifies the queue to use for holding the call, and specifies the routing method to use for hunt groups or the questions and answers to use for interactive response groups. A workflow also defines settings such as a welcome message, music on hold, business hours, and holidays.

You use the Response Group Configuration Tool to create workflows. You can access the Response Group Configuration Tool from the Response Group page of Lync Server Control Panel.


> [!NOTE]
> You must create agent groups and queues before you create a workflow that uses them.
