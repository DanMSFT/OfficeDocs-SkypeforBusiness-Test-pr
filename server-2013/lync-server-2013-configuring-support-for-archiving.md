# Configuring support for Archiving in Lync Server 2013

 


After adding Archiving to your topology and publishing the new topology, you need to configure options for how Archiving is initially implemented in your deployment, and then configure one or more Archiving policies to enable Archiving for your deployment and, optionally, for specific sites and users. You can use Lync Server 2013 Control Panel to do this.


> [!NOTE]
> After deployment, you can change Archiving settings to disable or enable Archiving. For details about how to implement archiving support for day-to-day management or to meet new requirements in your organization after deployment, see <A href="lync-server-2013-managing-archiving.md">Managing Lync Server 2013 Archiving</A> in the Operations documentation.
