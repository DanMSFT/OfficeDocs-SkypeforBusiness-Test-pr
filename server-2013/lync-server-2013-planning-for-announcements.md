# Planning for announcements in Lync Server 2013

 


The Lync Server Announcement application lets you configure the handling of incoming phone calls when the dialed number is valid for your organization, but is not assigned to a user or a phone. You can transfer these calls to a predetermined destination (phone number, SIP URI, or voice mail), or play an audio announcement, or both. The Announcement application helps you avoid the situations in which a caller misdials and hears a busy tone or the SIP client receives an error message. This section includes planning information that is specific to the Announcement application.
