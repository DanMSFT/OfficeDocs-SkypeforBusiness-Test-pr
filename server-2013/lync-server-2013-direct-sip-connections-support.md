# Direct SIP connections support in Lync Server 2013

 


Lync Server 2013 supports the use of direct SIP connections to connect Lync Server 2013 to either of the following:

  - An IP-PBX

  - A PSTN gateway

The Mediation Servers in a Lync Server 2013 pool can control multiple gateways, Session Border Controllers (SBCs) provided by telephony service providers, or some combination thereof. Additionally, multiple Mediation Servers in the pool can interact with a single gateway.

You can use the Microsoft Unified Communications Open Interoperability Program for enterprise telephony infrastructure to find qualified PSTN gateways, IP-PBXs, and SIP trunking services. For details, see the Microsoft Unified Communications Open Interoperability Program website at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=203309](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=203309).

For details about the topology and deployment options for direct SIP connections, see [Direct SIP connections in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-direct-sip-connections.md) in the Planning documentation.
