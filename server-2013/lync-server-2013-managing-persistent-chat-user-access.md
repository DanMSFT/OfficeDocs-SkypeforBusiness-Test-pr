# Managing Persistent Chat user access in Lync Server 2013

 


The following topics describe how to use the Lync Server 2013 Control Panel and the **Persistent Chat** page to manage user access in Persistent Chat. To manage Persistent Chat Server, you must have Persistent Chat administrator rights and permissions in the system. When you install Persistent Chat Server, you specify one or more users who have the necessary Persistent Chat administrator rights and permissions. To grant administrator rights and permissions to additional user accounts, use **Manage Users and User Groups**. For details, see [Enabling a user to manage categories, chat rooms, and user rights and permissions in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-enabling-a-user-to-manage-categories-chat-rooms-and-user-rights-and-permissions.md).
