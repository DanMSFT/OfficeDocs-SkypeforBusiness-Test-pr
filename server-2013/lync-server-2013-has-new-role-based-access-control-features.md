# New role based access control features in Lync Server 2013

 


Lync Server 2013 enhances the role-based access control (RBAC) feature in two major ways. You can now create custom roles, which each have privileges for only a set of cmdlets you specify. These custom roles can also be given privilege to run scripts of cmdlets.

Additionally, Lync Server 2013 includes two new predefined roles.

  - Users given the *Response Group Manager* role can manage specific Response Group queues in your organization, but not necessarily have management rights for other queues or the Response Group application as a whole.

  - Users given the *Persistent Chat Manager* role can manage specific Persistent Chat rooms in your organization, but not necessarily have management rights for other rooms or the Persistent Chat feature as a whole.
