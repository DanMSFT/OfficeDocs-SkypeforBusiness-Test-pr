# Device Update rules in Lync Server 2013

 


Periodically, Microsoft releases a new set of device firmware updates for Lync Phone Edition. *Device update rules* associate firmware updates with hardware devices—phones and other devices running Lync Phone Edition.

To get the latest set of device update rules, go to the Help and Support page on the Microsoft website, and search for "Phone Edition." Download the update package, and extract the files to a folder on the computer where the updates are to be uploaded. After the files have been extracted, import the device update rules found in the extracted .CAB file (which have the name UCUpdates.cab). Then, use the Lync Server Control Panel or Windows PowerShell cmdlets to view and manage these rules for your organization’s devices.

The following topics tell you how to import, view, and manage device update rules.
