# Hardware and software requirements for edge components in Lync Server 2013

 


The hardware and software requirements for edge components include those for the Lync Server 2013 communications software components, including Edge Servers and the optional Directors. For details about the components required to support external user access and supported topologies, see [Components required for external user access in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-components-required-for-external-user-access.md).

## Hardware for Edge Servers and Directors

Hardware recommendations and requirements are defined in the Supportability section. For Edge Servers and for the optional Directors, the recommended hardware configurations are detailed in the following topic. In Planning, see [Server hardware platforms for Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-server-hardware-platforms.md).

## Software Requirements for Edge Servers and Directors

Operating system requirements for Edge Servers and for the optional Directors are consistent with other Lync Server 2013 roles. Supported operating systems are detailed in [Server and tools operating system support in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-server-and-tools-operating-system-support.md).

Additional components and software requirements for Edge Servers and for the optional Directors are detailed in [Additional software requirements for Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-additional-software-requirements.md).
