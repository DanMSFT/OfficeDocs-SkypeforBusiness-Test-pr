# Configure announcements in Lync Server 2013

 


When you configure announcements, you are really configuring how you want calls to unassigned numbers to be handled. You can play a prompt, which can be an audio file or a text-to-speech (TTS) file, or you can just transfer the call to a specified destination without playing a prompt.

You need to create announcements before you define the unassigned number table. You need to perform this step for all announcements that use an audio prompt, a TTS prompt, or no prompt.
