# (Optional) Verify Announcement deployment in Lync Server 2013

 


After you install and configure Announcement, you need to verify the configuration to make sure that calls to unassigned numbers work as expected. At minimum, verify the following:

  - Call a number that is valid for your organization but is an unassigned number.

  - Call the unassigned number and verify that the correct announcement plays.
