# Configure user access for federation with a Lync Online customer in Lync Server 2013

 


You must configure the user accounts of all the users in your organization in order for them be allowed to communicate with federated partners. This configuration is applied for all federated partners, including any Microsoft Lync Online 2010 customer domains with which you support federation. For details about configuring federation support for user accounts, see [Configure policies to control federated user access in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-configure-policies-to-control-federated-user-access.md) and [Assign an external user access policy to a Lync enabled user in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-assign-an-external-user-access-policy-to-a-lync-enabled-user.md) in the Operations documentation.
