# (Optional) Verify the Group Call Pickup deployment in Lync Server 2013

 


After you enable Group Call Pickup for users, verify that the configuration works as expected. At a minimum, verify the following:

  - Call a user who is enabled for Group Call Pickup and have another user retrieve the call. The other user can be in the same group, in a different group, or not have Group Call Pickup enabled.

  - Call a user who is enabled for Group Call Pickup and do not answer the call.
