# Configure dial plans for dial-in conferencing in Lync Server 2013

 


When you deploy dial-in conferencing, you need to create or modify one or more dial plans for routing dial-in access phone numbers. Make sure that at least one normalization rule in each dial plan converts telephone extensions into complete phone numbers in E.164 format. Users of dial-in conferencing join conferences as authenticated enterprise users by entering their personal identification number (PIN) and their phone number. You need a normalization rule to convert extensions into complete phone numbers so that users can be authenticated when they enter just a telephone extension.

To set up dial plans for dial-in conferencing, do the following:

  - Whether or not you deploy Enterprise Voice, modify the global dial plan to add a dial-in conferencing region and to make sure that a normalization rule accurately converts your dial-in access numbers. For detailed instructions, see [Modify a dial plan in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-modify-a-dial-plan.md).

  - If you did not deploy Enterprise Voice, create dial plans for your dial-in conferencing access numbers. Be sure to include a dial-in conferencing region. For detailed instructions, see [Create a dial plan in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-create-a-dial-plan.md).

  - If you deployed Enterprise Voice, modify Enterprise Voice dial plans as necessary to include regions and use appropriate normalization rules for dial-in access numbers. For detailed instructions, see [Modify a dial plan in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-modify-a-dial-plan.md). You can also create dedicated dial plans that are used only for dial-in access numbers. For detailed instructions, see [Create a dial plan in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-create-a-dial-plan.md).

For details about planning regions, see [Dial-in conferencing requirements in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-dial-in-conferencing-requirements.md) in the Planning documentation.
