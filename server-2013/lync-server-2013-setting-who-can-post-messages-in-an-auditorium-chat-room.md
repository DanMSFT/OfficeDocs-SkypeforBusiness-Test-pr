# Setting who can post messages in an auditorium chat room in Lync Server 2013

 


In an auditorium chat room, only users who have been granted the role of Presenter can post messages. All other members can only read messages. Presenters in an auditorium chat room must be members of the chat room.

For details about using the Windows PowerShell command-line interface to manage auditorium chat rooms, see [Manage rooms](manage-rooms.md) in the Deployment documentation.

Although Persistent Chat room administrators and chat room managers can manage chat room settings, they cannot post in an auditorium chat room unless they are **Presenters**.
