# Administering servers after migration

 


In general, you must use the administrative tool that corresponds to the server version that you want to manage. You cannot install the Lync Server 2010 and the Lync Server 2013 administrative tools on the same computer. Also, the Lync Server 2013 Control Panel is not installed automatically on each server. To install the Lync Server 2013 Control Panel, follow the procedure inside the topic [Install Lync Server 2013 administrative tools](lync-server-2013-install-lync-server-administrative-tools.md) in the Deployment documentation.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> After a Lync Server 2013 pilot pool is deployed, you cannot use Lync Server 2010 Topology Builder or Lync Server 2010 Control Panel to manage any Lync Server 2013 resources. You must use Lync Server 2013 tools to manage Lync Server 2013 and Lync Server 2010 resources.
