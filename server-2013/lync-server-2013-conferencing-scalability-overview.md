# Overview of conferencing scalability in Lync Server 2013

 


The maximum size of a conference hosted on Lync Server 2013 in a shared pool (that is, a pool that hosts all Lync Server 2013 workloads including instant messaging (IM) and presence, conferencing, and Enterprise Voice) is 250 users.

Before we discuss using Lync Server to support larger meetings, let’s look at the scalability testing methodology we use and how we determine the 250-user model for shared pool testing.
