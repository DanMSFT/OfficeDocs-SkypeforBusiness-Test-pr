# Hosted Exchange Unified Messaging integration in Lync Server 2013

 


In addition to the support that previous Lync Server 2013 releases have provided for integration with *on-premises* deployments of Exchange Unified Messaging (UM), Lync Server 2013 introduces support for integration with *hosted* Exchange UM. Hosted Exchange UM enables Lync Server 2013 to provide voice messaging to your users if you transfer some or all of them to a hosted Exchange service provider such as Microsoft Exchange Online.

Lync Server 2013 Enterprise Voice uses the Exchange UM infrastructure to provide call answering, call notification, voice access (including voice mail), and auto attendant services. For details, see [Features of integrated Unified Messaging and Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-features-of-integrated-unified-messaging.md).
