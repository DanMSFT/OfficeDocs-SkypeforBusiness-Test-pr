# Meeting configuration settings in Lync Server 2013

 


In Lync Server 2013, conferencing policy defines the user scheduling and participation experience, and meeting join settings located on the meeting configuration page define the following:

  - Whether users dialing in from the public switched telephone network (PSTN) go to the lobby

  - Who can be a presenter

  - Whether conference type is assigned by default

  - Whether anonymous (unauthenticated) users are admitted by default

The topics in this section describe how to configure meeting join settings.
