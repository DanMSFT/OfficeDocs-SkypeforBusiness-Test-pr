# Managing network subnets in Lync Server 2013

 


You can use either Lync Server 2013 Control Panel or Lync Server 2013 Management Shell to manage network subnets. In most deployments of Lync Server 2013 where call admission control (CAC) is implemented, there will typically be a large number of subnets. Because of this, it is often best to configure subnets from the Lync Server Management Shell.
