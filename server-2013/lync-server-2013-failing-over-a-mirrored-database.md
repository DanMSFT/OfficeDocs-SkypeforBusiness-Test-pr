# Failing over a mirrored database in Lync Server 2013

 


If you have configured your back-end database to use synchronized mirroring with a witness, failover is automatic. If you have configured synchronized mirroring without a witness, you can use the following procedures to failover and failback your database. You can also use these procedures to manually failover and failback your databases even if you have configured a witness.

## To fail over your back-end database

1.  Before failing over, determine which back-end database is the principal and which is the mirror by typing the following cmdlet:
    
        Get-CsDatabaseMirrorState -PoolFqdn <poolFQDN> -DatabaseType User

2.  If the Central Management store is hosted in this pool, type the following cmdlet to determine which is the principal and which is the mirror for the Central Management store:
    
        Get-CsDatabaseMirrorState -PoolFqdn <poolFQDN> -DatabaseType CentralMgmt

3.  Perform the failover of the user database:
    
      - If the primary has failed and you are failing over to the mirror, type:
        
            Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover -PoolFqdn <poolFQDN> -DatabaseType User -NewPrincipal mirror -Verbose
    
      - If the mirror has failed and you are failing over to the primary, type:
        
            Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover -PoolFqdn <poolFQDN> -DatabaseType User -NewPrincipal primary -Verbose

4.  If the pool hosts the Central Management Server, perform the failover of the Central Management store.
    
      - If the primary has failed and you are failing over to the mirror, type:
        
            Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover -PoolFqdn <poolFQDN> -DatabaseType CentralMgmt -NewPrincipal mirror -Verbose
    
      - If the mirror has failed and you are failing over to the primary, type:
        
            Invoke-CsDatabaseFailover -PoolFqdn <poolFQDN> -DatabaseType CentralMgmt -NewPrincipal primary -Verbose
