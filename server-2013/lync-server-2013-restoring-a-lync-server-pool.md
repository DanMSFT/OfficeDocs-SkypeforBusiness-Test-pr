# Restoring a Lync Server pool in Lync Server 2013

 


Your Lync Server deployment may include any of the following types of pools:

  - Front End Server

  - Mediation Server

  - Persistent Chat Server

  - Edge Server

If an entire pool experiences an outage, follow these procedures for each member server in the pool.

  - For a Front End pool, restore the Back End Server first, and then restore each Front End Server. For details, see [Restoring an Enterprise Edition Back End Server in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-restoring-an-enterprise-edition-back-end-server.md) and [Restoring an Enterprise Edition member server in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-restoring-an-enterprise-edition-member-server.md).

  - For all other types of pools, restore each member server. For details, see [Restoring an Enterprise Edition member server in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-restoring-an-enterprise-edition-member-server.md).
