# Adding a Persistent Chat administrator in Lync Server 2013

 


In Lync Server 2013, users who perform specific tasks must be assigned as members of one or more specific groups. Role-based access control (RBAC) can also be used to grant privileges by assigning users to predefined Lync Server 2013 administrative roles.

Before configuring and administering Persistent Chat Server, be sure that the appropriate user rights and permissions are in place, and that any users to be classified as Persistent Chat administrators are added to the CsPersistentChatAdministrator security group.
