# Windows Update for Lync Server 2013

 


Frequently check for and apply updates and security updates using Windows Update Services. Doing so helps prevents vulnerabilities in other system components that might lead to attackers being able to gain access to servers running Microsoft Lync Server 2013 with administrator rights and thereby compromise Lync Server 2013.

Updates for Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Express (64-bit edition) runs on each Lync Server 2013 Standard Edition server (for the back-end database) and on all other Lync Server 2013 server roles (for the Local Configuration Store), unless you have upgraded these databases to SQL Server 2008 R2 Express. You should consider these databases as part of routine security update maintenance, as should SQL Server on the back-end database of a Front End pool, the Monitoring database, and the Archiving database.

## Best Practice

  - Keep current with Windows Update.
